This example shows you how to use the host and port so you can set up a script to run your project in dev mode on a specific host and port. This will use your ip address as opposed to localhost meaning you can then open it on your mobile/tablet and easily test how it looks using a real environment making debugging so much easier. Take a look at the package.json to see the script and once you run it you will see in the terminal on what port and host your site is listening on.
